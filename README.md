# PlantsVsZombies.net Mod

#### Description
A mod of the opensource cross-platform C# Plants Vs Zombies remake (originated from codes in an olde-mobile version) PlantsVsZombies.NET, it is not a website, but rather a .NET application.

#### Software Architecture
The whole project comprises of three parts, which are *Lawn*, *Sexy*, and *Sexy.TodLib*.
*Lawn* contains the very mechanic of the game system, including picking and spawning zombies, setting on the shooter plants, etc.
*Sexy* works as the intermediate layer between the top-level of the game and XNA framework, providing several managers which help to control multimedia resources, and basic UI widgets.
*Sexy.TodLib* controls of the rendering of graphic FXs.
